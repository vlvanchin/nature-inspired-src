# Blue Tea (Butterfly blue tea) 

> pluck 2 or 3 of Butterfly Pea flowers, 

> rinse them well 

> take a tea cup and fill it with hot water (hot enough to make tea)

> put all the flowers into the hot water, and leave it for 5 minutes. You can enjoy the blue color streaks coming and mixing into water.

> remove the flowers 

> now it is ready to drink

The most beautiful and tasty blue drink ever! Also Butterfly Pea flower has a lot of benifits. :)
